    <br>
    <li>To make the curry sauce, heat the oil in a saucepan and sweat the vegetables for 10 minutes, or until softened. Add the curry powder, apple and stock and simmer for 20 minutes until all the vegetables are softened and the sauce is reduced. Blend to a smooth sauce with a blender or in a food processor. Pass the sauce through a sieve if you prefer a very smooth texture.</li>
    <br>
    <li>To make the dressing, mix the tomato, chilli, ginger, coriander seeds and lime juice together in a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Toss the roasted vegetables and halloumi in this dressing. Place the curry sauce in the bottom of a serving bowl and top with the roasted vegetables and halloumi. Serve immediately.</li>
