  <h3>Celebrate Pancake Day with this simple, one-egg pancake recipe.</h3>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <h4>For the pancakes</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>6 tbsp plain flour</li>
    <li>pinch salt</li>
    <li>1 medium free-range egg</li>
    <li>250ml/9fl oz full-fat milk</li>
    <li>butter or vegetable oil, for frying</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>For the toppings</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1 lemon, halved, for squeezing</li>
    <li>caster sugar, for sprinkling</li>
    <li>1 banana, peeled and chopped</li>
    <li>4 tbsp toffee sauce</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Sift the flour and salt into a large bowl. Make a well in the centre and crack the egg in. Add the milk, whisking gradually, until the batter is smooth and thick but still runny.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Heat the butter or vegetable oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat and then pour off any excess. Add about 2 tablespoons of batter to the pan, spreading the mixture evenly to coat the pan. Cook for 1 minute until golden brown on the underside. Flip and cook on the other side for 1 minute until golden brown. Transfer the pancake to a plate and serve with lemon and sugar or banana and toffee sauce. Repeat with the remaining batter, keeping the pancakes warm in a low oven if you want to eat them all at once.</li>
